# Model 1 Logistic Regression No Covariates code

This is the code to perform a Logistic Regression with no covariates as a first approximation to model the activation of voxels using the information from different studies. This model uses simulated data.


### Prerequisites

It would be useful to install Rstudio (you can download it here https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) since all the code was initially developed with that tool.

You can also run it from the terminal using Rscript and a pdf with the histogram will be generated.

## How to run it

You just have to download it or copy/paste it in an r script.

## Output

The output of this code is the chain from the sampling of beta_0 and a histogram of the distribution of beta_0 and the real mean.

## More information

For more information about the model please read Model_1_description.tex

The R version used to write this code is 3.4.2
