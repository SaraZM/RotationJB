	*Challenge/exercise* : try to find 1 or 2 places where you think the material could be clearer, or correct a typo, or add a link to some good material, etc. Fork the repository, clone it on your laptop, make some changes to the material (in the _episodes/*.md files), push to your fork on github, and then propose a pull request to the module-reproducible-basics auhors ! Note: They may not accept it. Alternatively, if you have something which is more a question you can raise an issue on the repo (https://github.com/repronim/module-reproducible-basics). For instance you could propose the addition of https://try.github.io/ if not in the material already.
